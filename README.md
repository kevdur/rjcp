# Reversible-jump Change Points in Julia

This is reimplementation of an example given by Green in his paper on
reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo, concerned with change-point detection.
The original implementation was done in Fortran and used Gibbs sampling for
within-model moves; this version is written in Julia and uses Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo instead.

Note: this was written before Julia 1.0 was released, and I haven't updated it
to work with that or newer releases. While the code here might be useful for
reference (or perhaps even useâ€”who knows), the main files of interest are the
two notes in the `doc` directory: the [first](doc/rjcp.pdf) summarising the
approach, implementation, and results; and the [second](doc/green.pdf) something
of a tutorial/exposition on the theory behind reversible-jump Markov chain Monte
Carlo.
