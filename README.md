# Reversible-jump Change Points in Julia

_See the [write-up](doc/rjcp.pdf) for full details._

This is a reimplementation of an example given by Green in his paper on
reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo
([https://doi.org/10.1093/biomet/82.4.711](https://doi.org/10.1093/biomet/82.4.711)),
concerned with change-point detection. The original implementation was done in
Fortran and used Gibbs sampling for within-model moves; this version is written
in Julia and uses Hamiltonian Monte Carlo instead.

Note: this was written before Julia 1.0 was released, and I haven't updated it
to work with that or newer releases. While the code here might be useful for
reference (or perhaps even useâ€”who knows), the main files of interest are the
two notes in the `doc` directory: the [first](doc/rjcp.pdf) summarising the
approach, implementation, and results; and the [second](doc/green.pdf) something
of a tutorial/exposition on the theory behind reversible-jump Markov chain Monte
Carlo.
